      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am brand new to the world of coding professionally but have been fascinated by it since I was a kid fiddling with HTML on my virtual pets.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Brooklyn, New York, but moved at age 2 to Tuscon, Arizona with my mom.  After a couple houses there and my mom getting remarried, our family moved to Colorado when I was 7. Once again we navigated a couple different houses and moved after staying in CO for 9 years.  At age 16 I was living in Minnesota, Cambridge to be specific.  Once I was accepted to University I moved solo to the Twin Cities and have lived in Saint Paul ever since.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love a lot of tech, like video gaming and digital art, but I'm also a traditionalist.  I'm an artist so I do watercolor, pencil sketches, acrylic, wood carving, and anything else I can get my hands on.  I'm also a trained musician so I play the guitar, sing, and can make my way around a keyboard OK.  Outside of that I enjoy exploring parks and hiking, cooking (especially from scratch), gardening, cuddling my two fat cats Duchess and Muffin, and reading basically anything.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I used to think my dream job was to be a professor at a University, studying and teaching art history or music history.  Now, though, that's been changing and my new dream job seems to be veering more into the tech and gaming field.  I want to code and create, become a web developer of some kind.  I'm still new to all this but it feels like the right direction, so when I have a more solid answer I guess I'll update this section.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently I'm in Northend Saint Paul.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love the creative potential of coding and full stack development.  It's more than just lines of code, it's being able to think abstractly, artistically, logically, and creatively all at the same time.  It's learning a new language from one that I already know, and it's watching instant feedback stream across my screen that I know I did.  I also love it because of the ability to see and change what's wrong almost instantaneously and jumping in to fix it before it causes too much damage.  I get to flex a lot of different mental muscles that I haven't had the change to do before.</p>
